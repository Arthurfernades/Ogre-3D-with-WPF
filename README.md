This repository demonstrates embedding the **Ogre 3D** engine into a **D3DImage** component within a **WPF** (Windows Presentation Foundation) application. This project uses **SWIG** to create bindings for Ogre 3D, enabling integration within .NET.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to seamlessly integrate the powerful rendering capabilities of Ogre 3D into WPF, allowing for enhanced 3D visualization within modern .NET applications.

### Key Features
- **Embedded 3D Rendering**: Utilizes D3DImage in WPF to enable high-performance, real-time 3D rendering.
- **SWIG-based Integration**: Uses SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) to create bindings for Ogre 3D in .NET, making it accessible in WPF.

### Requirements
- **Ogre 3D**: A scene-oriented, real-time, flexible 3D rendering engine.
- **SWIG**: A tool to generate .NET bindings for C++ libraries like Ogre 3D.
- **WPF**: Windows Presentation Foundation, used for creating rich desktop applications.
